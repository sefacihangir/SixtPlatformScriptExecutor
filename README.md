# SixtPlatformScriptExecutor

I have created five packages. 

 Model package ==> I have created the VulnerabilityScript class .This is the base domain object .

 ScriptEngine package ==> I have defined a script executor interface for Vulnerability script and  the scripts deriving from our base Vulnerability script. And I also created a class named VulnerabilityScriptExecutor which is implementing the interface I defined . In execute method which takes a Script object as a parameter, I have recursively execute the dependent scripts and main script. For creating the dependent script objects I have used the script factory class which I injected this executor class as an attribute.
 
 ScriptFactory package ==> In this package I have defined an interface where I implied the footprints of create method. And in the concrete class which is implementing this interface I have created the script object.
 
 Util Package ==> In this package, I have created a static method for parsing  the Scripts.txt file to get the dependencies of the given script id. 
 
 Test Package==> In this package, I have tested some cases based on the ids in the Scripts.txt file. Below is a test case and its corresponding results  .You can find the Scripts.txt file in the root of the project
 
The Scripts to in the file ==>

1 44 23 76
8 4 5 88
3 76 71
12 3 6 87
4 13 12 95 23
13 87 3 2

if the test class is run with the script id 8 ,all its dependents recursively executed. The script with the id 8 is executed last.

The Script id :87 is executed....
The Script id :76 is executed....
The Script id :71 is executed....
The Script id :3 is executed....
The Script id :2 is executed....
The Script id :13 is executed....
The Script id :76 is executed....
The Script id :71 is executed....
The Script id :3 is executed....
The Script id :6 is executed....
The Script id :87 is executed....
The Script id :12 is executed....
The Script id :95 is executed....
The Script id :23 is executed....
The Script id :4 is executed....
The Script id :5 is executed....
The Script id :88 is executed....
The Script id :8 is executed....
